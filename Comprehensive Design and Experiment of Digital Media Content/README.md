Comprehensive Design and Experiment of Digital Media
===
Some programs for experiments of digital media.  
Image editor
---
The requirement of this project is to design a program which can open a image, such as *.bmp, *jpg and so on. And it can adjust the brightness and contrast of the opened image. Moreover, I want to get the extra grade so that I add some functions which are very simple and similar to those in the Adobe Photoshop.   

There are two version, the [Java version](https://github.com/Mr-Phoebe/ProgramDesign/tree/master/Comprehensive%20Design%20and%20Experiment%20of%20Digital%20Media%20Content/edit_image) and the [MATLAB one](https://github.com/Mr-Phoebe/ProgramDesign/tree/master/Comprehensive%20Design%20and%20Experiment%20of%20Digital%20Media%20Content/matlab%20photoshop)(2016b).  

And there still are something wrong in Java version. Even thought I think the mistakes could be easily handled, I will not update in the future.  

Personal Website
---
The requirement of this project is to design a website which can show the information of the person and experiments. And others can upload and download the multimedia files in the website.  

And there are something wrong in the HTML, because I didn't take scroll bars into consideration, so if one upload too much files, some of them won't be seen.  

<s>And the CSS is in a jumble, I am trying to fix it.  </s>
